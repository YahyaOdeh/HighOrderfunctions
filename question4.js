  // use high order functions to print elements of array
  // complete the code 
  //[1,2,3,4,5]


  
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
 
numbers.forEach(number => {  
  console.log(number);
}); 
  
  // what is the difference between map and forEach ??

  // Map makes a new array and put the new values at it.. on the other hard forEach works as a for loop without making a new array
